# LifespanQR
Academical Android app that allows users to track the expiry date of the ingredients they buy.

- Supermarket staff can generate and export QR Codes that contain the name, brand and expiry date of an ingredient
- Customers can later scann these QR Codes in-app
- Scanning a QR Code allows the user to add the ingredient to his list. Optionally, an event will be added to the device's calendar, pertaining to the expiry date
- If the user is signed in, the ingredient list is stored online (Google Realtime Database), otherwise it is stored offline
- Offline items will be syched with the cloud when the user signs in or goes back online
- Ingredients can be marked/unmarked as consumed or deleted
