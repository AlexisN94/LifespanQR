# LifespanQR
Academical Android app that allows users to track the expiry date of the ingredients they buy.

The app allows generating and exporting QR Codes that contain the name, brand and expiry date of an ingredient. Theses QR Codes can later be scanned in-app by the ingredient-buyer. Upon scanning, the user can add the ingredient to his list and, optionally, automatically create a new event in the device's calendar pertaining to the expiry date. Alternatively, the user can manually add ingredients.
If the user is signed in, the ingredient list is stored online, otherwise it is stored offline. Offline items will be syched with the cloud when the user signs in or goes back online.

Ingredients can be marked/unmarked as consumed or deleted, of course.
