# LifespanQR
Academical Android app that allows users to reate, save and scan QR codes with information about an ingredient. Particuarly, about its expiry date. 

When an ingredient is scanned, it can be added to the user's list and an event for the expiry date will be added to the device's calendar. 
If the user is signed in, the ingredient list is stored in the cloud, otherwise it is stored offline. 
Offline items will be syched with the cloud when the user signs in or goes back online.

Ingredients can be marked/unmarked as consumed.
